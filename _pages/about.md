I completed my undergraduate studies in compputer science at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) in 2021. I completed my master's studies in computer science at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) in 2023. My research interests include computer vision, computer graphics, deep learning, machine learning, and AI4Science. I have explored various topics such as oriented object detection, semantic segmentation, object recognition, and vision-language models. My work focuses on leveraging advanced technologies to tackle complex interdisciplinary challenges.
